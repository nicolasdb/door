# Error Handling and System Resilience

## Comprehensive Error Management Strategy
Robust, multi-layered approach to detecting, logging, and recovering from system errors.

## Error Detection Mechanisms

### System-Level Monitoring
- Watchdog timer (30-second timeout)
- Continuous system state checking
- Automatic reset on unresponsive states

### Component-Specific Error Tracking
- WiFi connection monitoring
- Network request error detection
- Door mechanism state validation

## Recovery Strategies

### Automatic Recovery
- WiFi reconnection attempts
- Exponential backoff for network retries
- Systematic reboot procedures

### Fail-Safe Mechanisms
- Default closed state for door mechanism
- Minimal system state disruption
- Preservation of critical system logs

## Logging and Diagnostics

### Error Logging
- Comprehensive error event recording
- Timestamp and context preservation
- Minimal performance overhead

### Diagnostic Information
- Detailed error context
- System state snapshots
- Root cause analysis support

## Specific Error Scenarios

### Network Errors
- Connection loss handling
- Timeout management
- Graceful degradation of services

### Hardware Interaction Errors
- GPIO pin error detection
- Relay control failure management
- LED status error indication

## Notification and Alerting
- Internal system logging
- Potential external notification mechanisms
- Error severity classification

## Security Considerations
- Prevent information disclosure
- Sanitize error messages
- Minimize system vulnerability exposure

## Performance Impact
- Lightweight error handling
- Minimal resource consumption
- Quick recovery procedures

## Continuous Improvement
- Error pattern analysis
- Systematic error response refinement
- Adaptive error management
