# Network Management

## Overview
Comprehensive network interaction and connectivity strategies for the Commons Hub Door Control System.

## WiFi Connection Management
### Connection Strategies
- Configurable SSID and password
- 10-second connection timeout
- Maximum 10 connection attempts
- Exponential backoff reconnection

### Resilience Mechanisms
- Continuous connection monitoring
- Automatic network interface reset
- Graceful handling of connection interruptions

## Diagnostic Capabilities
- Real-time RSSI tracking
- Detailed connection status reporting
- Comprehensive connection attempt logging

## Error Handling
### Exponential Backoff
- Increasing delay between connection attempts
- Maximum delay of 60 seconds
- Prevents resource-intensive reconnection

### Failure Recovery
- Systematic reconnection approach
- Prevents prolonged connection failures

## Status Indication
- LED-based connection status
- Callback mechanism for connection events

## Security Considerations
- Secure credential storage
